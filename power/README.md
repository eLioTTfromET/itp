# Power

making this program was really simple! the template you provided really helped. i just copied your template and pasted it onto my code. i started filling in the blanks after i counted the number of stars on the first line (to make sure that it was 64 stars). once i figured this out, i knew i needed to do 8 to the power of 2! and the rest would fall into place. the print_graph function was the easiest to set up, since it uses knowledge from last week. i put some print functions with the for loop using the n variable to reference. i put in x \*_ n in get_power. at first, i didn't understand why my "get_power" function wasn't working. i could easily do the graph without using the get_power function, but for some reason the code would fail if i tried using get_power. by just multiplying i _ i calling print_graph in the for loop, i could print out the stars. once i figured out i needed the "return" part in my get_power function, it was smooth sailing. i plugged it in, and it worked! ethan helped me out by showing me on their program that they had used "return" on the get_power function. works great!
