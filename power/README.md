# Power

making this program was really simple! the template you provided really helped. at first, i didn't understand why my "get_power" function wasn't working. i could easily do the graph without using the get_power function. by just multiplying i \* i calling print_graph in the for loop, i could print out the stars. the print_graph functino was the easiest to set up, since it uses knowledge from last week. once i figured out i needed the "return" part in my get_power function, it was smooth sailing. works great!
