The program was easy to make! I just made a calculation and used \n and \t quite a few times in the print function. I narrowed it down to using just one line of code where all calculations and printed text is happening within the print function. I did it all in class, so my teacher's guidance caught a mistake in what I had done and I corrected it. I then decided to narrow it down to one line.
