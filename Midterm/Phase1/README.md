# Phase 1

This step was super easy!

I started searching for cool visuals to create while in class. I looked up visual illusions and found something simple enough: a repetitive sequence of gray bars with white circles and a black background. This option was one among multiple, but none other captivated my attention for this project.

I grabbed a graph paper from an old notebook. I drew up the first version a little big. I had done 9 black squares on the inside with the lines and the circles 5 squares high and wide. I thought this was too big. I wanted the circles to be the same square size as the square in the middle and for all to be about equally proportional to each other with just one black square in the middle. I drew up another version with just the one black square in the middle. I liked this better. I used pencil first and when I had my idea down solid, I went back with pen. Time to move on to next phase...
