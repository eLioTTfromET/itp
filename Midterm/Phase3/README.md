# Phase 3

Oh man, this step was real easy! It's crazy how simple things can be when you follow instructions.

Before anything else, my instinct said to just copy and paste the code that was put up as an example. But no no, I decided to read a little bit of the instructions before that. And of course, It was a lot easier to use the original code and make updates, as was outlined. So I did. I then read straight from the example code what was new and bringing it into my code not understanding what it would do, but I had a sense of what it would do. I then moved around some values to get a sense of what everything does. After I felt kind of comfortable with the new objects or functions, I went back to the instructions and read through what I needed to do. I deleted push and pull to see what it would do, and of course, as the instructions said it made the second function reference the value that is put in the first calling of the function. This is pretty cool though; it made it easier to make a larger array of the objects in an orderly fashion.

Now to move onto phase 4. This phase was real simple, but I heard crazy things about the last phase. We'll see what I can get...
