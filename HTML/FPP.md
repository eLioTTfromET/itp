# Eliott Mendoza's Final Project Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Eliott Mendoza's super duper hip website

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

My project is a website that I use to describe my practice, put up some basic contact information, set up links and displays of my work, and put up information of some upcoming performances. I will decorate the webpage to resemble my style, with some subtle movement on the webpage.

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

1. The source code of racheldevorah.studio
2. https://javascript.info/css-animations
3. https://javascript.info/js-animation

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The website will be one unified place where all my work and public social media accounts can be found. The webpage will feature some basic movements that are not overly stimulating. The webpage will look like it was drawn with crayons, with some of the words shuffling a little bit to look lively and fuzzy. The website will have an easy way for me to update so that I may continuously add more as I grow. The contents of the website will likely live somewhere in California (or some obscure place websites like to live) and be accessed with the link elmendo.za or elmendoza.studio. Ideally, I would want the contents of the website to live in my apartment.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

All the information and links to my stuff will be there. Some of my poetry will be there. A description of me and my practice will be there. The colors and fonts of things will at least be aesthetically pleasing to me.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Some use of JavaScript and CSS to make the website have some animations. Allow some easy access for me to be able to update the webpage seamlessly. Prototype a web synth.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

At best, I have a cool custom cursor (like a crayon) for the webpage and a fully functional and basic web synth that I would build on in the future so that I, or anyone for that matter, could access the synth on the internet for any personal use.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

By April 18, I will have gathered the information I want to put on the webpage.
By April 25, I will have put the information up using the source code of racheldevorah.studio and monome.org as a guide for laying out my information.
By May 2, I will research and attempt to implement some animations with the information on javascript.info.
By May 9, if I am satisfied with the animations I have done so far, I will have prototyped a web synth (with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uasGsHf7UYA) after I figure out how to get a cool cursor for the webpage.
