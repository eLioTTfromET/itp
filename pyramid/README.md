# Pyramid and FuzzBuzz!

This project was pretty fun figuring out. I was doing pyramid, and I got the beginning part of it figured out pretty easily. Then I got to brainstorming for the spaces, and I figured: it's almost the same! I just need to print spaces horizontally. So I created a new variable that would print at each line, testing which line it is to decide how many spaces it should move over. Pretty simple.

FuzzBuzz was pretty simple, too. I started by just trying to make the first 5. This was pretty easy to do using modulus, although the range was starting at 0. I decided to easily fix this by having the range start at 1. I then continued to 15 to see how to print FuzzBuzz when it's both 3 and 5. I thought this "if" statement needed to be the first one, for this one is the one that has most priority, since it's produced the least. I then did elif for the 3s and 5s, and else for the rest of the numbers. Pretty simple stuff, I tell you!
